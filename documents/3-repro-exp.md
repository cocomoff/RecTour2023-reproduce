# 3. Re-producing previous experimental results

In [#2](2-repro-data.md), we explained re-production scripts to generate (extended) travel log data. Next, we explain how to re-produce existing research results using baseline solvers (Popularity and Markov@K). Some implementations are from [CIKM2016 repository](https://bitbucket.org/d-chen/tour-cikm16/src/master/).


## 3-1. Solvers

Baseline solves are implemented in `src/tour`.
