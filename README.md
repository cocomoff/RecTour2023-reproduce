This anonymized repository could be available during the period of the RecSys2023 conference. Please see the contents below as the companion content and our submission if you are interested.

If you want to run our resources, you need to either (1) do pre-processing YFCC100m metadata or (2) download pre-processed meta files (`meta16.tar.gz`) from `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emSW4BfrbvFYx4A49QASjSHXmH7HpEMZ/view?usp=share_link` and decompress them in the directory `new-meta`.
